# bot-or-human

This project is for the course TDT4310 Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding spring 2020 at NTNU. The system predicts whether a tweets are authored by a bot or a human and compares the results of three well known and widely used classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is made available for the [PAN19 Author Profiling: Bots and Gender Profiling](https://pan.webis.de/clef19/pan19-web/author-profiling.html). You can request access at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3692340).

## Prerequisites

- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Pickle
- Matplotlib
- NLTK

Packages can be installed using [pip](from xml.dom import minidom).

Example:

```python
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Configuration

The project is configured using the `config.py` file and enable step by step development creating checkpoints. Decreasing run time aspreprocessing and training can be saved, thus avoiding tedious latency. In the `config.py` file, set `read_and_save_raw_data_as_dataframe`, `load_preprocessed_dataframe`, `load_preprocessed_dataframe_of_test_data` and `load_trained_model` to `False` in order to do all processing from scratch.

## Results

The classification results for all the classifiers are printed to the console and confusion matrices are saved in `.png`-format to `results/`.
